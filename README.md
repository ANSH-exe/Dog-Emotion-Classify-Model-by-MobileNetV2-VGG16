# Dog-Emotion-Classify-Model-by-MobileNetV2-VGG16
# Overview : 

The project aims to build a deep learning model that can classify the emotions of dogs based on their facial expressions. The model is trained on a dataset of dog images with labeled emotions such as happy, sad, angry, and neutral.

# Technology Used:

    Python programming language
	
    TensorFlow deep learning framework
	
    Keras library for building and training deep learning models
	
    MobileNetV2 and VGG16 pre-trained convolutional neural network architectures
	
    OpenCV library for image processing and manipulation
  
# Machine Learning Models Used:
  
    MobileNetV2 : A lightweight CNN architecture designed for mobile and embedded devices. It uses depthwise separable convolutions to reduce the number of parameters and improve efficiency.
  
    VGG16 : A widely used CNN architecture that consists of 16 layers. It is known for its high accuracy on image classification tasks but requires more computational resources than    MobileNetV2.
